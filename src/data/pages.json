Guti</strong> out of a burden after observing many Christian business people struggling and failing to run their businesses and losing properties including houses after failing to pay back loans. Many Christian business people were going to him seeking counselling on family relationships that were being negatively affected by failing businesses.</p>\n    <p class=\"text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4\">From this, Archbishop Dr Ezekiel H. Guti was moved by God to teach business people on how to run Godly businesses, that bring joy at home and success. This became the start of ACBF.</p>\n  </section>\n  \n  <section class=\"our-objectives-section mb-12\">\n    <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-10 pb-3 border-b-2 border-primary text-center\">Our Objectives</h2>\n    <div class=\"objectives-grid\">\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">1</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To offer consultative work.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">2</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To be involved in charitable work.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">3</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To establish a Christian Business Fund.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">4</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To help those who are starting their businesses.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">5</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To meet the spiritual needs of business people.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">6</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To help those who are having problems managing their businesses.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">7</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To raise funds by providing, or encouraging sales of work.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">8</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To organize lectures, seminars calculated to benefit the organization.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">9</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To fulfil the great commission, and to win other business people to Christ.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">10</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To provide a network of business people for the coordination of activities, and exchange of information.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">11</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To invest any monies of the organization which shall be held for the purpose of the organization.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">12</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To sponsor and coordinate conferences, and other activities that bring Christian business people together with a view to enhancing the international character of business people.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"objective-item\">\n        <div class=\"objective-number\">13</div>\n        <div class=\"objective-content\">\n          <p>To establish a network of Christian business people all over Africa, and all nations based on biblical principles, and without losing contact with their creator, <em class=\"text-primary font-semibold\">Genesis 24:1</em> - Abraham was rich, but did not lose contact with God.</p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </section>\n</div>",
